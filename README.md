# NETFLIX-ANALYSIS


About Dataset

Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows, and original contents. This
dataset is a cleaned version of the original version which can be found here. The data consist of contents added to
Netflix from 2008 to 2021. The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. This dataset will be
cleaned with MSQL and visualized with POWERBI. The purpose of this dataset is to test my data cleaning and
visualization skills. The cleaned data can be found IN PROJECT and the POWERBI dashboard can be found .

Data Cleaning
We are going to:

1. Treat the Nulls
2. Treat the duplicates
3. Populate missing rows
4. Drop unneeded columns
5. Split columns
Extra steps and more explanation on the process will be explained through the
code comments

In this project, we:
1. Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and
converting data types.
2. Explored the data through various visualizations such as bar plots and word
clouds.
3. Analyzed content trends over time, identified popular genres, and highlighted
top directors.

Next Steps
1. Feature Engineering: Create new features, such as counting the number of
genres per movie or extracting the duration in minutes.
2. Machine Learning: Use the cleaned and processed data to build models for
recommendations or trend predictions.
3. Advanced Visualization: Use interactive plots or dashboards for more detailed
analysis.
This project is a foundational exercise that introduces essential data analysis
techniques, paving the way for more advanced projects.
